function tm_set_new(obj, speed, accel, incline)
% TM_SET Sends a treadmill control panel remote control packet.
%    TM_SET(obj, speed, accel) Sets the belt speeds and accelerations.
%    Resets incline position 0.
%
%    TM_SET(obj, speed, accel, incline) Sets the belt speeds,
%    accelerations, and incline position.
%
%    obj is an opened instrument communications object obtained from
%    udp() or tcpip().
%
%    The speed is given in m/s. The acceleration is given in m/s^2.
%    The incline angle is given in degrees above horizontal.
%
%    The speed and accel can be vectors or scalars. If both are vectors,
%    the vectors must be of same size. A scalar value is applied to
%    all belts. A vector value's indices are assigned as follows:
%
%    1 - right (front) belt
%    2 - left (front) belt
%    3 - right rear belt
%    4 - left rear belt
%
%    Values for indices not provided are assumed to be zero speed,
%    and 1 m/s^2 acceleration.
%
%    Values for belts not present on the treadmill are ignored.
%
%    The acceleration must be nonzero. Its sign is ignored.
%
%    See also TCPIP, UDP, FOPEN, FCLOSE.
